# Content Configuration Files

This folder contains all editable content for the website. You can update these files directly without needing coding knowledge or AI assistance.

- CV

**How to edit:**

### `howItWorks.ts`
Edit the "How It Works" page content, including:

## Tips

- Text between single quotes `'...'` is short text (titles, labels)
- Text between backticks `` `...` `` is longer text (paragraphs, descriptions)
- You can use basic formatting in paragraphs (line breaks work naturally)
- After editing, the changes will appear on the website automatically
